# CurrencyExchangeiOS
Foreign exchange iOS app in SwiftUI

Things for improvement:
- The paid version of the API gives access to different endpoints which would save on making multiple requests (for the historical records). I'd use that instead of making multiple calls to the API
- Better test coverage, added one simple test to showcase that the code is testable
- Improved UI :-)
